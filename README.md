# Thanos Simulator
So in Indonesia there's two booming "trend". First one is Presidential Election, and second one is Avengers:EndGame.

On Presidential Election, Candidate from PDIP Political Party, Mr. Joko Widodo wins the Election by 55.5% voting vs his opponent Mr. Prabowo Subianto which backed by Gerindra by 44.5%. 

On Avengers:Endgame, well I think there's no need to explain this one since everybody watch it anyway. :D

Then I was wondering if Thanos snapping his fingers with five stones, removing exacly half people in Indonesia, and then we held re-election, will the presidential election giving a different result? If so, how much is the difference?

This is by assuming some thing:
1. Both candidate of presidential Election will not vanish.
2. Program will removing exactly 50% from the voters.
3. Re-election is held and all people re-choosing what they're choosing before without any changes.
4. There's no cheating and 100% voting is valid.

By percentage, what do you think will happen?
1. Most likely be the closer with previous percentage ~ 55.5% vs 44.5%
2. Moving closer to 50%-50% percentage
3. Moving further from 50%-50% percentage

By people, which voters probably wiped out more?
1. Most likely the same
2. Jokowi's voters
3. Prabowo's voters
